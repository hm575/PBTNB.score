## Description 

* This document contains R code necessary to calculate per-base mono-, di-, and tri- nucleotide bias score (PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score) for individual fragments respectively as described in the manuscript: Markus, Chandrananda, Moore, et al. **Refined characterization of circulating tumor DNA through biological feature integration** (2021). <doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.11.21261907>
* The sections below give a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the scores for example fragments using the pre-calculated PCA loadings from the manuscripts.

## Calculating PCA loadings

* 10 random bootstrap sets (RBS) of 3 million fragments was generated from both the pool of controls and HGSOC Patient 5.
* For each RBS the per-base mono-, di-, and tri- nucleotide frequency was calculated for regions -10bp and +10bp of fragment start and end sites respectively. These where summarized in a matrix where each row was one RBS and the columns were the per-base nucleotide frequencies. 
* Pricipal component analysis (PCA) was then carried out to calculate loadings of PC1 of fragment start and end per base mono-, di-, and tri- nucleotide frequency matrix.
* These steps are described in the image below.

* PC1 loading vector of mono-, di-, and tri- nucleotide frequency are provided in `loadings/pca_loadings.mono.start_end.RData`, `loadings/pca_loadings.di.start_end.RData` and `loadings/pca_loadings.tri.start_end.RData`
  * The provided vectors are concatenations on fragment start and end PC1 loadings.

## Calculating PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score

* Given the PC1 loading vectors, the PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score can be calculated for an individual fragment.
* For a fragment, two binary vectors are created that indicate whether a given mono-, di-, or tri- nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment start and end sites respectively.
* The fragment start and end vectors are concatenated together, and dot product is taken with the PC1 loading vector to get the PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score.
* These steps are described in the image below.

## Example script

* The script below will be used to calculate the PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score for 49 example cfDNA fragments given the DNA sequence -10bp and +10bp of fragment start and end sites respectively.
* The sequence of these fragments are provided in `sequences/start_seq.RData` and `sequences/end_seq.RData`
* The script also requires an empty frame of per-base di- and tri- nucleotide frequency that will ensure the PC1 loading association with each motif at a given position match motif and position of the given fragment. These are provided in `sequences/empty_diNuc_perBase.RData` and `sequences/empty_triNuc_perBase.RData`

```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(foreach)
```

### Load the data

```{r load_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
output_RData_file <- "/Users/hmarkus/Desktop/Thesis_Cambridge/AfterThesis/PBTNB_score"
load("loadings/pca_loadings.mono.start_end.RData") ## cont_pca_loadings_mono_start_end
load("loadings/pca_loadings.di.start_end.RData") ## cont_pca_loadings_di_start_end
load("loadings/pca_loadings.tri.start_end.RData") ## cont_pca_loadings_tri_start_end

load("sequences/empty_diNuc_perBase.RData") ## empty_diNuc_perBase
load("sequences/empty_triNuc_perBase.RData") ## empty_triNuc_perBase

load("sequences/start_seq.RData")
load("sequences/end_seq.RData")

## fragment start sequences
start_seq %>% head()
## fragment end sequences
end_seq %>% head()
```

### Calculate score

* The for loop in the code below with loop through each fragment to calculate its PBMNB-score, PBDNB-score, and PBTNB-score 
* `mono_start` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given mono-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment start site.
* `mono_end` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given mono-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment end site.
* `double_binary_start` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given di-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment start site.
* `double_binary_end` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given di-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment end site.
* `triple_binary_start` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given tri-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment start site.
* `triple_binary_end` contains the binary vector that summarizes whether a given tri-nucleotide motif is present at a given position of -10bp and +10bp of fragment end site.

* Looking at the distribution of the PBTNB-score

plot(density(score_frame$PBTNB.score), main = "PBTNB.score")
